# Bomb Diffusal Game

A game/competetion where the person has to diffuse the bomb by rewiring/removing the correct connections under a stipulated time. This code is shown to the player to find the correct wire to remove. 
The time keeping (clock) is not implemented in this section of the code. It can be an input which gives a HIGH voltage when the time is over.

This code is intentionally made hard to read/understand using pointers, references etc. Remove all comments before showing this code to make the difficulty really high.
